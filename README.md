# DFRobot IO Expansion Hat Library for Rust
Discontinued: Failed to reproduce the OEM software. The code is copied 1:1 though. Use at own risk.

## Objectives

- Support driving PWM outputs
    - ADC functions are copied stubs, completely untested.
- Support driving servomotors

## Licensing

Based on the OEM library https://github.com/DFRobot/DFRobot_RaspberryPi_Expansion_Board, license unknown. Don't think they'll sue me because I'm helping them proliferate their expansion board lmao
